classcode
=========

These are all of the class codes, and you can access them to practice for next time. We will meet periodically based on
when each of you wishes to meet. This way everyone is able to learn at their own rate. You all have to learn at our own
pace and becuase of that you will have to take the iniative to actually practice as well as schedule times to code with
me. What you need to do is either text me, or you can email meat skroductions16@gmail.com. Happy coding. May the BEST
NERD WIN!
